Reina and I go out for lunch at a nearby diner. I ordered a burger and fries, while she had some alfredo pasta, something I _would’ve_ liked if it didn’t also have spinach, tomatoes, and mushrooms.

We talked a bit with each other about our coworkers and the company in general.

Whenever Note came up, I tried not to act too conscious about it, but she poked and prodded either way.

It’s not my fault he’s... really cute, kind of my type, cuddleable-looking, and everything.

[Reina] Well, I would say you should just _go for it_, but I know how hard that is for you. It’s fine to just take your time and let things warm up between you two over time. Just try not to act too distant with him.

Would be easy if he wasn’t always distant to... well, everyone, and everything.

But I thought back to this morning, when he gave me the bun. A _special privilege_, apparently. Naturally, it makes me wonder what he thinks about me. And I smile.

[Ryder] ...Yeah. We’ll see. I dunno. I just... I don’t think I’ve ever had a... well, a crush, if that’s what this is.

[Reina] It’s definitely a crush.

I turn redder. I frown, as if a thousand tiny emotional needles of shame are pricking at my casual ‘go with the flow’ facade. I sigh, folding my arms.

[Ryder] Fine, it’s a crush.

She chuckles at me. _Mockingly_, probably.

I metaphorically crumble under the weight of my bashfulness.

I hate her.

[Reina] You’re adorable.

I HATE HER SO MUCH.

[Reina] Well, I won’t tease you too much about it. But I will say, you’ll look even more adorable alongside him than normal.

I’m dead. I’m just deceased. I’m gone. Fucking gone. I have left the physical plane. I am _withering_. There is nothing left of me.

...If only saying that could actually make me disappear. The best I can do is bury my face in my palms while she pitifully ruffles my hair.

[Ryder] W-we should head back, I think.

[Reina] Oh, right! I guess time flies when you’re having fun, right?

When _you’re_ having fun, maybe.

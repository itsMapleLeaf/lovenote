## The First Day

Well, here I am.

This is it.

I'm not really nervous. When it comes to stuff like this, as long as there's a set time and place, I just go and deal with it.

.[delay:0.5].[delay:0.5].[delay:0.5]

I'm a liar. I'm really nervous.

I want to disintegrate into dust.

But my one true talent is hiding that. So I'll be fine.

Probably.

[animation:office_wide_fade_in] Although the building is pretty big, it's not nearly as tall as those high rise office skyscrapers.

It's a smaller company, thankfully. I don't think I could survive the culture of a big businessy business.

Processes. [delay:0.5] Eugh.

Big bold letters on the side read: "Hilight Studios."

It's kind of a niche game company with a decently varied backlog.

RPGs, visual novels, rhythm games, and an action puzzle platformer that almost won indie game of the year a few years back at the Game Awards.

To be honest, I haven't played many of their games, but I heard good stuff about them, so I figured it wouldn't hurt to apply when I saw they were hiring.

They interviewed me over Zoom. I only met a few people from here, but they seemed like a fun crew who really cared about what they do, and we vibed a lot, apparently.

So, here I am.

[animation:office_front_fade_in] [delay:1] [animation:ryder_enter] I slow down at the front door for a bit. There's a small bit of anxiety that I might be entering the wrong door, or that I'm too early, or a trillion other dumb things my brain could come up with.

I wait a bit to see if someone else goes in first. But not for too long, otherwise I'll look shifty.

I'll get out my phone, make it look like I'm waiting for an Uber or something.

...

I feel like such a dumbass.

[???] [animation:reina_enter] Oh! Hey, Ryder!

My anxiety immediately melts away, and my spirits are lifted.

I am warm. I have transcended.

[Ryder] Oh, hey Reina.

I couldn't be happier to hear a familiar face and voice.

The plain, casual smile I give doesn't at all match the unending waterfall of joy and relief I feel inside.

I slip my phone into the pocket of my hoodie, and I walk inside with Reina.

She's my twin sister. We applied to the same company, but for different positions.

I'm going in for UI design, and she's going in for soundtracks.

Reina’s loved music since we were kids. She's godly at the piano, and her singing voice is divine.

Makes me wonder if I grew up with an angel.

It hurt a little when she left home to live on her own, but I wouldn't be a good brother if I selfishly held her back.

Plus, we live like five minutes apart anyways.

She calls for the elevator, and the big sliding doors open up right away. Then she hits the button for the third floor.

Thank fuck she remembered the floor, because I sure as hell didn't.

We lean back against the elevator wall. My stomach falls as it rises.

I take a sip from my can of iced vanilla coffee. Simultaneously, she sips from her can of macha green tea.

[Reina] So, nervous for your first day?

I shrug.

[Ryder] Not really. Kinda just going along with the flow.

[Reina] As a coping mechanism?

She leans in with the deadliest, most annoying smirk. I look away, trying not to frown too hard. Failing.

[Ryder] S-so what? Don't act like you aren't nervous too.

Reina softens her advance and reels back.

[Reina] And I'm willing to admit it. Because, as a responsible adult, I'm able to acknowledge my feelings instead of stoically hiding them and pretending everything's always fine all the time.

I'm going to punch her.

[Reina] You wouldn't have even come in here if I hadn't met up with you, would you?

I'm going to fucking punch her.

[Reina] But that's fine.

She sighs, the smugness in her expression fading, as well as my childish disgruntledness.

[Reina] Growing old doesn't mean we grow out of dumb human feelings, right? With new opportunities, new frontiers, new environments, being anxious and nervous is only natural. And it goes away pretty quickly.

Reina confidently sticks her nose up, with one eye opened looking at me.

[Reina] If you can't ease the anxiety, just push through knowing it'll all become another boring routine to you in the end. That's when you can find the small little things that make it special.

...I hate her.

I hate her so goddamn fucking much.

How she teases me into a corner, then comes up with an actually motivating motivational speech.

[Ryder] ...Yeah. I guess.

I smile like a goddamn fucking idiot. She mirrors it, as if taking yet another victory between us.

And somehow, I don't mind.

Maybe later I'll treat her to some cookies from her favorite bakery down the street.

The elevator slows. My stomach rises. It kept rising even after stopping.

[animation:reina_pats_and_leaves] Reina ruffles my hair before leaving. I used to protest and smack her hand away, but now I just take it and grumble like the bitchy queer-ass little bottom that I am.

## New Friends

Thankfully, I'm not so much of an idiot that I forget where I'm supposed to go.

It wouldn't matter, though. There are colorful signs plastered on the walls pointing all the new hires in the right direction.

Signs crudely drawn with markers, big bubble letters, with stars and fancy decorations.

And you can't miss the little chibi anime characters saying "Welcome!", "You can do it!", and "Hope you like it at Hilight!"

Heh. I’m lucky no one’s watching me smile like a moron.

Programming, soundtracks, modeling, animation... UI. That's me.

I carefully venture through the room, past all the desks arranged in quad spaces.

The um... _personality_ is overwhelming.

One desk is practically buried in anime figurines, posters, and random props, like toy sabers and Nerf guns.

Another has so many plushies stacked on it, I wonder how they haven't fallen over.

The third has its walls covered in... math equations? And other mugs and posters with references from games that are too obscure for me to remember, but not enough that I still recognize them as references.

It's almost like people are waging a "Most Aggressively Decorated Desk" war out here.

Although, I respect it. Like my sister, I respect anyone who can express themselves so freely like this.

Well, more like envy, but in some way... same thing?

Either way, I reach my desk. It's got my name on it.

Thank God, otherwise I'd have agonized over whether it was actually mine and just awkwardly walked around until I was sure.

A tiger plush sits on my desk, holding a card that reads "Welcome to Team Tiger!"

So the plush person ran out of room. Got it.

Team Tiger, huh? I guess that explains the pictures of animals I saw. A leopard, a lion, a cheetah, a... jaguar, I think? All are big cats.

That's kinda cute.

So it seems like I'll just be sitting and waiting a bit. I must be early.

I look at a clock on the far wall. It's already five past. Maybe-

[???] _GAAAAAASSP!_

Whatever line of thought I was _going to_ have crashed and burned as an extremely exaggerated gasp scares the absolute shitters out of me.

[???] New meat! New meat! New meat!

I can only assume this obtusely hyperactive girl is referring to me.

That inspires confidence.

[Tabby] You must be Ryder! It's great t’meetcha! I'm Tabby!

Her handshake throws me so hard for a loop that I can barely take in her features.

Navy blue shoulder straps showing through the collar of a loose over-the-shoulders cropped orange t-shirt, a pair of jean shorts, white socks, and sneakers to complete.

The worry that I was too casually dressed immediately faded away.

More accurately, Tabby shook it out of me.

Past Tabby, I see another presumed Team Tiger member letting out a big yawn as she approaches, arms stretched high.

She’s wearing a white shirt with shoulder frills, a black skirt with white stockings under, and a black choker.

Elegant. Mysterious. Mature.

That _would've_ been my first impression, but the girl immediately slumps into her desk, grabbing one of the many plushies from the plush mountain next to her.

The mountain is still standing...

[Tabby] Awwh, Runa! Y’can’t just go and take a nap right in front of the newbie, it'll make us look bad!

[Runa] Mmnh. Just a few more minutes...

And she was out, no matter how much Tabby shook her.

I _wish_ I could fall asleep that fast. Damn.

[Tabby] Weeelllll that's _prooobably_ not the best first impression, but trust me when I say that Runa’s the real veteran here! Whatever obscure questions y’might have, high chance she's got an answer!

[Ryder] Uh... r-right. I-

[Tabby] Oh, looks like Note’s just got here too!

Huh? A note got here?

I turned my head to look where Tabby’s looking.

[Ryder] HUAH?!

A person.

There's a person just... there.

They weren't there when I came in.

There's no way I couldn't have seen them.

What the fuck.

[Tabby] C’mon Notey-Note, put down yer work for two seconds to greet our new family member, why dontcha?

Oh, wait... ‘Note’ is his name?

Wait, family member?

[Note] Hello.

Note turned a bit in his swivel chair to me, with a blank, expressionless look, and an equally benign wave.

He looks about my age and height with white hair, fluffy like snow, with deep scarlet-colored irises.

He wore a long red open-shoulder sweater that went past whatever shorts or spats he wore under.

Assuming he wore them.

Worn with a pair of comfy-looking white thigh-high socks, with a visible inch of the two garter straps hooked to them.

He simply sat still in his chair, hands clad in black fingerless gloves planted in his lap.

A small silver heart hung from his necklace. It sparkles in the light of the room.

The band of his necklace rested against a subdued collarbone, only further extenuating his androgynous figure, from his rounded-off shoulders to his hips.

[Tabby] Heya uh... You good there, Ryder?

I flutter my eyelids, looking back and forth between Tabby and Note.

[Ryder] Oh, uh- ...y-yeah. Sorry, just lost in thought for a bit.

I'm such an awful liar. Thankfully, one person is oblivious, another is sleeping, and the third doesn't seem to show any emotion.

Tabby's worried look immediately disappears in place of that bright grin, and she aggressively smacks me on the back.

[Tabby] Well don't space out too much now, y’hear? We've got a meetin’ coming up here soon!

I glance out towards the open halls past our desks, to where people are starting to gather into a larger meeting room.

[Tabby] You can grab a snack or somethin’ if ya want. Meetings suck on an empty stomach, heh.

As if on cue, my stomach unceremoniously growls. I couldn't hide the heat on my cheeks if I tried.

Tabby manages a smirk that somehow rivals my sister's. I'd be impressed if I weren't dematerializing from embarrassment.

I feel a feather-light tap on my shoulder.

[Note] Here... If you like sweets.

Note holds out a cinnamon bun wrapped in plastic. He has a few others stashed on his desk.

Damn, someone came prepared.

[Ryder] Oh, uh... thanks.

I feel a little bad, but I don't really know how to say "no" anyways.

Note quietly nods. He takes one for himself, unwrapping and taking a bite on the way to the meeting room.

I watch him.

...

I feel a gentle elbow at my side. Not enough to hurt, but more than enough to make me squeal like the fairy boy I am.

Not too loudly. Otherwise I might've _actually_ fucking died.

[Tabby] Looks like you've already made a friend! Lil’ ol’ Notey don't share his snacks with just anyone. Took a month for me to get one, can ya believe it?

She laughs as if it's some grand phenomenon, but I bet she just begged him and he eventually caved.

[Runa] He just caved after you pestered him enough.

Knew it.

Looks like sleeping beauty came back to the land of the living, though.

She does another yawn and stretch before returning her plush to its rightful place in the tower.

The tower that...

No, fuck you. I don't fucking care. That pile of plush should be _toppling_. **Crumbling**. I \*absolutely fucking **refuse\*** to believe any human on this _damned_ gay Earth has the necessary finesse to-

[Tabby] Well, that's what we call haggling back where I'm from! I gave ‘im something back the next day, ‘member?

[Runa] A head ruffle isn't equivalent exchange for food.

[Tabby] Well it darn sure looked like he appreciated it!

...

The two continued like this as they followed Note to the meeting room.

Runa doesn't seem to know the true value of a head ruffle. I wonder what dystopian world she came from.

[Runa] Ryder, are you coming?

[Ryder] Oh, yeah. Sorry.

I hurry up a bit to catch up before matching their pace. I unwrap my bun for a bite while I'm at it.

...

This is the same bun that tempts me whenever I'm checking out at CVS.

But it tastes a lot... sweeter.

And softer.

...

I take another bite.

## The First Meeting

The meeting room looks like you’d expect, with a big long table in the middle, tall windows looking out into the city, a few whiteboards on the walls, projectors, microphones, and some decorative plants.

Most of the swivel chairs surrounding the table were already occupied by the other teams. It looks like a little more than 20 people.

I take my seat close to the rest of my team.

Tabby was busy with Runa talking about her weekend. In vivid detail, with exaggerated gestures and everything.

I’ll never understand people who actually _do stuff_ on weekends, other than like... play games or laze around.

Note’s sitting on my side opposite to them. It looks like he’s passing the time with a Nintendo DS.

He’s playing Rhythm Heaven. Good taste.

Everyone else is smiling, talking, and generally having fun, giving the room a noisy but warm and homey atmosphere.

I’m not really a crowds person, but it feels less like a crowd and more like... a club?

It’s nice.

It doesn’t take me long to spot Reina and her team.

All guys, but there’s only one "guy guy" and others who just look really fruity or twinkish.

They’re wearing lion ear headbands. I guess I know what team they are.

Also, cute.

Holy shit, cute.

She hit it off with them pretty well, already fitting in nicely.

A far cry from me just being overwhelmed and anxious.

Reina spots me back and gives me a wave. I wave back to her before she returns her attention to her teammates.

[Reina] That’s my brother over there. His name’s Ryder. I’ll introduce you sometime!

I feel like I’ve already had my fair share of meeting people, but I guess I don’t wanna seem cold and antisocial either.

Even if I am. Reina probably knows that.

[Tabby] Oh, d’you know her?

Tabby caught me waving at Reina. Note raised his head as well.

[Ryder] Ah, yeah. She’s my twin sister.

[Tabby] Oooh, we got a set of cute twins at the same time? Ain’t we lucky!

She grins bright, throwing finger guns at me, and Runa chuckles.

I’m going to pass out from blood loss if they keep making me blush like this.

[Runa] Your sister’s really pretty, though. She seems nice, too.

Runa watched Reina with a gentle smile, cheek resting on her palm.

I don’t want to jump the shark, but that’s definitely not a look you give to someone you just want to be friends with, right?

...She seems like a nice match for her, though. _If_ things go in that direction. I know better than to be pushy. Not that I’m the kind of person to do that anyhow.

Before I start to wonder when the actual meeting is going to start, two guys walk in. The one with fluffy blonde hair’s wearing an orange jacket, black jeans, and a pair of headphones. He claps his hands in the air. The other with shorter fuzzy-looking brown hair, tanned, and a bit more muscular, wears a plain black shirt and a pair of khakis, quietly smiling as he follows behind the other, hands in his pocket.

I can already see the dynamic between these two. The energetic one and the calm, grounded one. Yin and yang.

They’re definitely boyfriends.

[???] Alright alright, everyone settle down so we can get this show on the road, alright?

He clears his throat.

[Nathan] Since we’ve got a few new faces here, I’ll go ahead and introduce ourselves. I’m Nathan, and this is Kyle.

Kyle lifts his hand with a friendly wave and smile.

[Nathan] We’re the cofounders of Hilight. The ones who keep the show running. Well, mostly Kyle keeping my ass from running around and veering off in random places, but y’know.

He gets a chuckle from the crowd, and a pat on the back from his partner.

[Nathan] Anywho, could I get the new hires to stand up for a sec? Don’t be shy, we promise we won’t grill ya.

Fuck. Haven’t people figured out that it’s the _attention_ that’s the problem, and that being nice about it doesn’t solve anything?

Reina’s already up though, giving a wave with a sparkly smirk as if she’s an idol onstage. A few others from different teams stand up as well.

I gasp from Tabby smacking my back, smiling big as the sun, as usual.

I begrudgingly stand up, averting eye contact as much as possible. But it felt a little nice knowing I wasn’t the only shy-looking one.

[Nathan] Welcome, and congrats! I hope you all enjoy your time here. Everyone, treat them real nice, okay? Don’t tease ‘em too much, now.

I can already see the devilish glean in Tabby’s eyes, with Runa chuckling beside her.

Whichever deity is real and listening, please give me your protection and wisdom. Please.

[Nathan] Alright, you all can sit down now. Sorry for puttin’ you on the spot like that.

Kyle rolled his eyes, as if to say ‘no he’s not’, and I believe it.

I settle back down into my seat as everyone else does, shrinking. I can still feel some lingering gazes on me. Probably looking back and forth between me and Reina, noticing we look similar and connecting the dots.

[Nathan] Alrighty, now that I’ve woken y’all up, I’ll hand it over to Kyle for our usual orders of business.

Kyle nods, and steps forward as Nathan stepped back.

From what I gathered, Hilight works on a handful of projects at a time.

Reina’s team and all of the others are working on a sequel to Celsius, the action puzzle platformer I mentioned earlier. It’s about midway through development, but needs catching up in the music department.

The other is a new VN that’s currently in the planning stages. It’s not much further than a rough draft and some concept art.

Reina and I’s positions slot in pretty sensibly and timely here. They’ve already got tasks planned and laid out, and we, along with the other new hires, pretty much already know what we’re getting into.

It’s refreshing as hell being able to get right to working on something without going through a long orientation process.

Although I guess the meeting serves the role of that; we stayed in there for almost an hour.

A lot of finer details were brought up and discussed, some hammered out and others left up in the air to decide on next time. Reina had a lot of questions to ask, and even some opinions to contribute, but I prefer to get whatever information I need as I need it.

If you’re thinking I just don’t like talking, you’re probably not wrong.

Eventually, the meeting ends, and everyone gives a big stretch, some leaving the room, going back to their desks or grabbing lunch, some lingering around a bit to talk to Nathan or Kyle, others just hanging for a bit.

I consider leaving, feeling a bit out of place, but, predictably I didn’t get the chance.

[Reina] Hey, Ryder!

Reina runs over to my group, stopping me before I could leave. She probably knew I was gearing to try to escape. I throw a glare at her, only to get back one of her demonic narrow-eyed smirks.

The brief twin telepathy gets some people around us snickering.

Either way, I put on my friendly "meeting new people" smile and voice while Reina introduces me to her teammates, also talking a bit with mine.

At first I felt a little disgruntled having to be social for longer than I intended, but Reina makes these sort of things a lot more comfortable, thankfully.

Even while she’s still teasing me in front of everyone.

## It’s Not a Crush

Reina and I go out for lunch at a nearby diner. I ordered a burger and fries, while she had some alfredo pasta, something I _would’ve_ liked if it didn’t also have spinach, tomatoes, and mushrooms.

We talked a bit with each other about our coworkers and the company in general.

Whenever Note came up, I tried not to act too conscious about it, but she poked and prodded either way.

It’s not my fault he’s... really cute, kind of my type, cuddleable-looking, and everything.

[Reina] Well, I would say you should just _go for it_, but I know how hard that is for you. It’s fine to just take your time and let things warm up between you two over time. Just try not to act too distant with him.

Would be easy if he wasn’t always distant to... well, everyone, and everything.

But I thought back to this morning, when he gave me the bun. A _special privilege_, apparently. Naturally, it makes me wonder what he thinks about me. And I smile.

[Ryder] ...Yeah. We’ll see. I dunno. I just... I don’t think I’ve ever had a... well, a crush, if that’s what this is.

[Reina] It’s definitely a crush.

I turn redder. I frown, as if a thousand tiny emotional needles of shame are pricking at my casual ‘go with the flow’ facade. I sigh, folding my arms.

[Ryder] Fine, it’s a crush.

She chuckles at me. _Mockingly_, probably.

I metaphorically crumble under the weight of my bashfulness.

I hate her.

[Reina] You’re adorable.

I HATE HER SO MUCH.

[Reina] Well, I won’t tease you too much about it. But I will say, you’ll look even more adorable alongside him than normal.

I’m dead. I’m just deceased. I’m gone. Fucking gone. I have left the physical plane. I am _withering_. There is nothing left of me.

...If only saying that could actually make me disappear. The best I can do is bury my face in my palms while she pitifully ruffles my hair.

[Ryder] W-we should head back, I think.

[Reina] Oh, right! I guess time flies when you’re having fun, right?

When _you’re_ having fun, maybe.

## Friction

Things eventually settle down, and I’m back at my desk with Tabby, Runa, and Note, with our chairs huddled in the middle of our space, discussing where we are, and our tasks so far.

Runa is handling a lot of the writing for the game, Tabby is in charge of art and animation, and Note is in charge of programming, scripting, storyboarding, and that kind of stuff.

Just about what you’d expect for everyone, really.

With the game as early as it is, they don’t really know the direction they want to take for the UI, so it’s my job to take charge of that.

I’m a bit nervous at first, but I eventually ease into a rhythm.

Our process is mostly me writing down ideas of how I think it could look and feel, borrowing from other VNs I’ve played.

Runa and Tabby are pretty onboard with a lot of my ideas, calling me a genius and everything.

Felt kind of nice.

Note, on the other hand... It takes a bit for him to speak up, but he’s... _really_ nitpicky about some things.

In kind of a cold way, honestly.

[Note] That seems like it’ll make navigation really confusing.

[Note] This’ll be really difficult to optimize.

[Note] You should try to keep in mind what our engine supports.

[Note] Games don’t really use shapes and arrangements like these nowadays. It’ll probably seem amateurish.

[Note] You should try to keep in mind different viewports.

[Note] Focus and active states will clash here.

[Note] There’s too much empty space.

It’s constructive, but he comes off like a judgmental know-it-all.

The "empty space" one peeves me the most. The point of good UI isn’t to overload people with all of the information we possibly can. That’s what I didn’t like about a lot of VNs I play.

[Ryder] Well, I think it’s important to only show what’s necessary. That, and I think it fits the vibe decently well.

[Note] I don’t agree. On larger screens, the bigger elements will just seem really goofy and unnecessary.

At some point, Runa and Tabby kind of fell into an awkward silence, not sure if they should intervene here. I feel like they could tell that I was starting to feel a little annoyed and backed into a corner.

Note definitely couldn’t.

[Note] You should try to think more about the player’s perspective. A lot of designers have ideas that don’t map well to what players intuitively expect. Or even worse, ideas that make trouble for the implementers.

[Ryder] I-...

...I go quiet for a bit, trying to come up with something to say, but I just suddenly feel so... inadequate.

Another silence follows.

Tabby looks at me for a moment. It looks like she doesn’t know what to say either. She looks to Runa, whose fists are balled up in her lap, seeming even more pained by the deadlock between us.

Note, on the other hand, patiently waits for a response, and he breaks the silence, speaking with a tone of genuine confusion.

[Note] Uh... Is there something wrong?

I feel like anything I _could_ say here would be the wrong thing to say. I’m just praying to Hatsune Miku that one of the others speaks up first and gets us out of this.

[Runa] Well... maybe it’s time for another short break, how about that? It looks like the general organization and navigation is up in the air, but the look and feel of the individual elements is more or less solidified, so that seems like a good place for Ryder to start.

I breathe a soft sigh of relief to myself. Runa, you have my blessing. Take good care of my sister.

[Tabby] Sounds good to me!

Predictably, Tabby’s tone goes right back to normal. With her being the pepper and chipper one, I’m surprised not to see her being the first to lift the mood back up.

Everyone has their strengths and weaknesses, huh?

Note doesn’t say anything else, simply returning to his desk, logging in, and working.

That silence stung more than if he kept talking.

[Runa] Are you familiar with the design software we use?

It leaves me wondering what other nags and patronizing judgments he has yet to throw at me.

[Runa] I know pretty much every designer uses it nowadays, but...

It just makes me feel like I’m not good enough for him.

[Runa] ...Uh... Ryder?

It made me scared that, if we got any closer, that’s all our time would consist of. Him being smarter and better at my job than me.

[Runa] Are you okay...?

[Ryder] O-oh, s-sorry, I uh... I-I was just... thinking.

Shit. She already looks worried.

I fucked up.

There was no good ending here. If I speak my mind, I hurt Note. If I stay silent, I worry the others.

Fuck this, man. Whoever wrote this story sucks at their job.

And of course I caught eye of Note peering back at me.

The fuck else do you have to say now?

...

[Ryder] I uh... I know how to use Figma. You’ll just have to get me added into the workspace and everything, and let me know if there are any conventions you use.

The change in subject brought out a soft sigh of relief from Runa. She looks to Tabby, who gives her a reassuring smile and pat on the shoulder.

[Runa] Sure. Let’s get you set up, then.

Runa slides over with me to my desk. She spends about half an hour helping me get onboarded onto the company accounts and such.

It looks like Tabby went back to hashing out more concept art, too. She’s actually hella good.

I feel like I’ve recognized her art style from somewhere, actually...

Maybe not.

I spend the final hours of the day working on designs, making sure all of my elements and layers are named well.

Keeping optimization in mind, I try not to go overboard with filters and stuff. Plus, simpler is better a lot of the time anyway.

I try to go for a more modern look to keep our game from looking too "Windows XP". Death to gradients. Mostly.

I try to add clear focus and active states for accessibility, and for the relevant components, I try to make sure it’s not unclear where any directional button will take you.

...

I’ve never taken criticism well. Only a while after getting it do I take those ideas to heart and acknowledge them.

I’m such a piece of shit.

## Understanding

The day ends. Everyone takes a big stretch and gets up from their desks.

Tabby and Runa engage in a bit more banter, Runa expressing how much she wants to take a nap, Tabby trying to tug her along for coffee.

That’s not a winnable battle, Tabby. Don’t fight sleepy people for their naps. They’ll fuck you up. Or maybe that’s just me.

Either way, they make their way out, waving to me as I’m cleaning up my work, getting to a good clean slate for tomorrow.

I feel a feather-light tap on my shoulder.

[Note] Here.

He hands me a big oatmeal cookie wrapped in plastic.

This is some deja vu.

But... Whatever negative feelings I had about him went away in that moment.

He’s not emotionless. He’s not careless. I gather he actually cares about others and what he does a lot more than those around him.

More accurately: he’s not afraid to show he cares.

But he doesn’t know how to show that without coming off as rude, mean, or... well, careless.

Emotions are probably difficult for him, so he has to make up for it and show what he’s thinking in other ways.

Like giving people snacks.

[Ryder] If you think I hate you or anything, you’re mistaken.

I take the cookie anyways.

[Ryder] I’m just... difficult, when people are picking apart my ideas. I still have trouble with it.

I watch Note pull something out of his pocket. It looks like a journal. He rapidly scribbles away and nods as he listens to me.

[Ryder] Are you... are you writing that down?

He freezes like a deer caught in headlights, or a kid caught with their hand in the cookie jar.

His cheeks turn red.

That’s the most emotion I’ve seen out of him since the first time I saw him.

Holy shit, my heart.

...

He nods meekly.

[Note] I... forget things like this a lot. And I can’t easily tell when people are uncomfortable. So I like to write people manuals.

"People manuals?" What the fuck? I’ve never heard a more adorable phrase in my life.

I have to keep myself from grinning like an absolute fucking moron.

[Ryder] I get it. It’s kind of the opposite for me, actually. I can usually gauge how people are feeling. I just don’t know how to deal with it, heh.

I might not be smirking like a dork with a crush, but a warm, friendly smile still manages to grace my lips.

[Ryder] I don’t think a ‘people manual’ would help in my case. Even if I knew how to deal with people, it’s the _dealing with_ part that’s hard. I just can’t step outside my comfort zone. It’s like there’s a big brick wall that just keeps me from... doing things, generally.

Now I’m just rambling. He probably doesn’t even care, just giving me that same blank look as when I first saw him.

[Ryder] I can’t read you at all, though. I kinda thought you were a bit robotic when I first met you. Could never tell what you’re thinking or feeling.

He blinks a few times. Silence. Then I start getting flustered and worried again.

[Ryder] I-I didn’t mean that as an insult. It just-

[Note] I get that a lot.

He interrupts me. Despite what I said, even though his tone of voice didn’t change from normal, I could tell it hurt a little to say that. I spotted him clutching the notebook a bit tighter too.

[Ryder] Hey, being different is fine. It’s great, really. It just makes you interesting. People who pick on you and don’t give you the light of day, they don’t deserve you. It looks like you’ve got a really good crew here, though. People who just treat you like... a person, without constantly poking at the un-normal ways that you act.

It hurt for me to say that, too. Somehow, I found something in common between us.

Of course it had to be something pitiful and depressing.

[Note] Un-normal isn’t a word...

Wh-huh? That wasn’t the poin-

Oh wait, he’s doing the thing.

Oh.

Heh.

Heheh.

[Note] ...Um... why are you laughing?

Oh my god. Oh my fucking god, he’s so cute. What the hell is wrong with me?

He still gives me that confused look as my dorkish chuckling dies down. I just... end up quietly staring at him.

I want to hug him.

[Reina] _Oh Ryyyderrr~_

Are you fucking kidding me.

[Reina] C’moooon, I’m hungry! I wanna go to that one bakery down the street.

Get your own goddamn cookies for fuck’s sake.

_God._

...

I sigh. I hate that I can’t keep myself from smiling around her. Especially with how she’s hanging her arms over my shoulders like this. She reels back after I stand up.

[Ryder] There’s a polite way to ask for things, y’know.

[Reina] But you’d be weirded out by that, wouldn’t you?

...Probably. I don’t even need to answer. We both know.

I sigh.

I look back to my former stoic and deathly adorable conversational partner.

[Ryder] Uh... yeah. I guess I’ll be heading out. See you tomorrow?

Note quietly nods. He turns back to pack his stuff as well. But I caught a glimpse of something right before he faced away.

Was that... was that a smile?

A tiny little smirk?

Oh my god. _Fuck me._

I would spend a thousand years in purgatory to see that smile again.

And, of course, as if reading my mind, Reina grins at me.

[Reina] So, are you two done flirting?

I swear I can see the devil horns poking out past her hair.

Note quickly turned his head to us, mouth slightly agape, as if trying to force out an excuse, or clear up a misunderstanding.

Yeah, I’m going to kill her one of these days.

I just take her hand and hurry out of there before Note can see me steaming from the ears.

...Hm. He likes sweets. Maybe I’ll give him something from the bakery tomorrow.

Is bribery a crime if I’m doing it for a hug?

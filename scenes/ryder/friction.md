Things eventually settle down, and I’m back at my desk with Tabby, Runa, and Note, with our chairs huddled in the middle of our space, discussing where we are, and our tasks so far.

Runa is handling a lot of the writing for the game, Tabby is in charge of art and animation, and Note is in charge of programming, scripting, storyboarding, and that kind of stuff.

Just about what you’d expect for everyone, really.

With the game as early as it is, they don’t really know the direction they want to take for the UI, so it’s my job to take charge of that.

I’m a bit nervous at first, but I eventually ease into a rhythm.

Our process is mostly me writing down ideas of how I think it could look and feel, borrowing from other VNs I’ve played.

Runa and Tabby are pretty onboard with a lot of my ideas, calling me a genius and everything.

Felt kind of nice.

Note, on the other hand... It takes a bit for him to speak up, but he’s... _really_ nitpicky about some things.

In kind of a cold way, honestly.

[Note] That seems like it’ll make navigation really confusing.

[Note] This’ll be really difficult to optimize.

[Note] You should try to keep in mind what our engine supports.

[Note] Games don’t really use shapes and arrangements like these nowadays. It’ll probably seem amateurish.

[Note] You should try to keep in mind different viewports.

[Note] Focus and active states will clash here.

[Note] There’s too much empty space.

It’s constructive, but he comes off like a judgmental know-it-all.

The "empty space" one peeves me the most. The point of good UI isn’t to overload people with all of the information we possibly can. That’s what I didn’t like about a lot of VNs I play.

[Ryder] Well, I think it’s important to only show what’s necessary. That, and I think it fits the vibe decently well.

[Note] I don’t agree. On larger screens, the bigger elements will just seem really goofy and unnecessary.

At some point, Runa and Tabby kind of fell into an awkward silence, not sure if they should intervene here. I feel like they could tell that I was starting to feel a little annoyed and backed into a corner.

Note definitely couldn’t.

[Note] You should try to think more about the player’s perspective. A lot of designers have ideas that don’t map well to what players intuitively expect. Or even worse, ideas that make trouble for the implementers.

[Ryder] I-...

...I go quiet for a bit, trying to come up with something to say, but I just suddenly feel so... inadequate.

Another silence follows.

Tabby looks at me for a moment. It looks like she doesn’t know what to say either. She looks to Runa, whose fists are balled up in her lap, seeming even more pained by the deadlock between us.

Note, on the other hand, patiently waits for a response, and he breaks the silence, speaking with a tone of genuine confusion.

[Note] Uh... Is there something wrong?

I feel like anything I _could_ say here would be the wrong thing to say. I’m just praying to Hatsune Miku that one of the others speaks up first and gets us out of this.

[Runa] Well... maybe it’s time for another short break, how about that? It looks like the general organization and navigation is up in the air, but the look and feel of the individual elements is more or less solidified, so that seems like a good place for Ryder to start.

I breathe a soft sigh of relief to myself. Runa, you have my blessing. Take good care of my sister.

[Tabby] Sounds good to me!

Predictably, Tabby’s tone goes right back to normal. With her being the pepper and chipper one, I’m surprised not to see her being the first to lift the mood back up.

Everyone has their strengths and weaknesses, huh?

Note doesn’t say anything else, simply returning to his desk, logging in, and working.

That silence stung more than if he kept talking.

[Runa] Are you familiar with the design software we use?

It leaves me wondering what other nags and patronizing judgments he has yet to throw at me.

[Runa] I know pretty much every designer uses it nowadays, but...

It just makes me feel like I’m not good enough for him.

[Runa] ...Uh... Ryder?

It made me scared that, if we got any closer, that’s all our time would consist of. Him being smarter and better at my job than me.

[Runa] Are you okay...?

[Ryder] O-oh, s-sorry, I uh... I-I was just... thinking.

Shit. She already looks worried.

I fucked up.

There was no good ending here. If I speak my mind, I hurt Note. If I stay silent, I worry the others.

Fuck this, man. Whoever wrote this story sucks at their job.

And of course I caught eye of Note peering back at me.

The fuck else do you have to say now?

...

[Ryder] I uh... I know how to use Figma. You’ll just have to get me added into the workspace and everything, and let me know if there are any conventions you use.

The change in subject brought out a soft sigh of relief from Runa. She looks to Tabby, who gives her a reassuring smile and pat on the shoulder.

[Runa] Sure. Let’s get you set up, then.

Runa slides over with me to my desk. She spends about half an hour helping me get onboarded onto the company accounts and such.

It looks like Tabby went back to hashing out more concept art, too. She’s actually hella good.

I feel like I’ve recognized her art style from somewhere, actually...

Maybe not.

I spend the final hours of the day working on designs, making sure all of my elements and layers are named well.

Keeping optimization in mind, I try not to go overboard with filters and stuff. Plus, simpler is better a lot of the time anyway.

I try to go for a more modern look to keep our game from looking too "Windows XP". Death to gradients. Mostly.

I try to add clear focus and active states for accessibility, and for the relevant components, I try to make sure it’s not unclear where any directional button will take you.

...

I’ve never taken criticism well. Only a while after getting it do I take those ideas to heart and acknowledge them.

I’m such a piece of shit.

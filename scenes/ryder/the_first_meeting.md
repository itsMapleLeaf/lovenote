The meeting room looks like you’d expect, with a big long table in the middle, tall windows looking out into the city, a few whiteboards on the walls, projectors, microphones, and some decorative plants.

Most of the swivel chairs surrounding the table were already occupied by the other teams. It looks like a little more than 20 people.

I take my seat close to the rest of my team.

Tabby was busy with Runa talking about her weekend. In vivid detail, with exaggerated gestures and everything.

I’ll never understand people who actually _do stuff_ on weekends, other than like... play games or laze around.

Note’s sitting on my side opposite to them. It looks like he’s passing the time with a Nintendo DS.

He’s playing Rhythm Heaven. Good taste.

Everyone else is smiling, talking, and generally having fun, giving the room a noisy but warm and homey atmosphere.

I’m not really a crowds person, but it feels less like a crowd and more like... a club?

It’s nice.

It doesn’t take me long to spot Reina and her team.

All guys, but there’s only one "guy guy" and others who just look really fruity or twinkish.

They’re wearing lion ear headbands. I guess I know what team they are.

Also, cute.

Holy shit, cute.

She hit it off with them pretty well, already fitting in nicely.

A far cry from me just being overwhelmed and anxious.

Reina spots me back and gives me a wave. I wave back to her before she returns her attention to her teammates.

[Reina] That’s my brother over there. His name’s Ryder. I’ll introduce you sometime!

I feel like I’ve already had my fair share of meeting people, but I guess I don’t wanna seem cold and antisocial either.

Even if I am. Reina probably knows that.

[Tabby] Oh, d’you know her?

Tabby caught me waving at Reina. Note raised his head as well.

[Ryder] Ah, yeah. She’s my twin sister.

[Tabby] Oooh, we got a set of cute twins at the same time? Ain’t we lucky!

She grins bright, throwing finger guns at me, and Runa chuckles.

I’m going to pass out from blood loss if they keep making me blush like this.

[Runa] Your sister’s really pretty, though. She seems nice, too.

Runa watched Reina with a gentle smile, cheek resting on her palm.

I don’t want to jump the shark, but that’s definitely not a look you give to someone you just want to be friends with, right?

...She seems like a nice match for her, though. _If_ things go in that direction. I know better than to be pushy. Not that I’m the kind of person to do that anyhow.

Before I start to wonder when the actual meeting is going to start, two guys walk in. The one with fluffy blonde hair’s wearing an orange jacket, black jeans, and a pair of headphones. He claps his hands in the air. The other with shorter fuzzy-looking brown hair, tanned, and a bit more muscular, wears a plain black shirt and a pair of khakis, quietly smiling as he follows behind the other, hands in his pocket.

I can already see the dynamic between these two. The energetic one and the calm, grounded one. Yin and yang.

They’re definitely boyfriends.

[???] Alright alright, everyone settle down so we can get this show on the road, alright?

He clears his throat.

[Nathan] Since we’ve got a few new faces here, I’ll go ahead and introduce ourselves. I’m Nathan, and this is Kyle.

Kyle lifts his hand with a friendly wave and smile.

[Nathan] We’re the cofounders of Hilight. The ones who keep the show running. Well, mostly Kyle keeping my ass from running around and veering off in random places, but y’know.

He gets a chuckle from the crowd, and a pat on the back from his partner.

[Nathan] Anywho, could I get the new hires to stand up for a sec? Don’t be shy, we promise we won’t grill ya.

Fuck. Haven’t people figured out that it’s the _attention_ that’s the problem, and that being nice about it doesn’t solve anything?

Reina’s already up though, giving a wave with a sparkly smirk as if she’s an idol onstage. A few others from different teams stand up as well.

I gasp from Tabby smacking my back, smiling big as the sun, as usual.

I begrudgingly stand up, averting eye contact as much as possible. But it felt a little nice knowing I wasn’t the only shy-looking one.

[Nathan] Welcome, and congrats! I hope you all enjoy your time here. Everyone, treat them real nice, okay? Don’t tease ‘em too much, now.

I can already see the devilish glean in Tabby’s eyes, with Runa chuckling beside her.

Whichever deity is real and listening, please give me your protection and wisdom. Please.

[Nathan] Alright, you all can sit down now. Sorry for puttin’ you on the spot like that.

Kyle rolled his eyes, as if to say ‘no he’s not’, and I believe it.

I settle back down into my seat as everyone else does, shrinking. I can still feel some lingering gazes on me. Probably looking back and forth between me and Reina, noticing we look similar and connecting the dots.

[Nathan] Alrighty, now that I’ve woken y’all up, I’ll hand it over to Kyle for our usual orders of business.

Kyle nods, and steps forward as Nathan stepped back.

From what I gathered, Hilight works on a handful of projects at a time.

Reina’s team and all of the others are working on a sequel to Celsius, the action puzzle platformer I mentioned earlier. It’s about midway through development, but needs catching up in the music department.

The other is a new VN that’s currently in the planning stages. It’s not much further than a rough draft and some concept art.

Reina and I’s positions slot in pretty sensibly and timely here. They’ve already got tasks planned and laid out, and we, along with the other new hires, pretty much already know what we’re getting into.

It’s refreshing as hell being able to get right to working on something without going through a long orientation process.

Although I guess the meeting serves the role of that; we stayed in there for almost an hour.

A lot of finer details were brought up and discussed, some hammered out and others left up in the air to decide on next time. Reina had a lot of questions to ask, and even some opinions to contribute, but I prefer to get whatever information I need as I need it.

If you’re thinking I just don’t like talking, you’re probably not wrong.

Eventually, the meeting ends, and everyone gives a big stretch, some leaving the room, going back to their desks or grabbing lunch, some lingering around a bit to talk to Nathan or Kyle, others just hanging for a bit.

I consider leaving, feeling a bit out of place, but, predictably I didn’t get the chance.

[Reina] Hey, Ryder!

Reina runs over to my group, stopping me before I could leave. She probably knew I was gearing to try to escape. I throw a glare at her, only to get back one of her demonic narrow-eyed smirks.

The brief twin telepathy gets some people around us snickering.

Either way, I put on my friendly "meeting new people" smile and voice while Reina introduces me to her teammates, also talking a bit with mine.

At first I felt a little disgruntled having to be social for longer than I intended, but Reina makes these sort of things a lot more comfortable, thankfully.

Even while she’s still teasing me in front of everyone.

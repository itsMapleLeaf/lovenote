The day ends. Everyone takes a big stretch and gets up from their desks.

Tabby and Runa engage in a bit more banter, Runa expressing how much she wants to take a nap, Tabby trying to tug her along for coffee.

That’s not a winnable battle, Tabby. Don’t fight sleepy people for their naps. They’ll fuck you up. Or maybe that’s just me.

Either way, they make their way out, waving to me as I’m cleaning up my work, getting to a good clean slate for tomorrow.

I feel a feather-light tap on my shoulder.

[Note] Here.

He hands me a big oatmeal cookie wrapped in plastic.

This is some deja vu.

But... Whatever negative feelings I had about him went away in that moment.

He’s not emotionless. He’s not careless. I gather he actually cares about others and what he does a lot more than those around him.

More accurately: he’s not afraid to show he cares.

But he doesn’t know how to show that without coming off as rude, mean, or... well, careless.

Emotions are probably difficult for him, so he has to make up for it and show what he’s thinking in other ways.

Like giving people snacks.

[Ryder] If you think I hate you or anything, you’re mistaken.

I take the cookie anyways.

[Ryder] I’m just... difficult, when people are picking apart my ideas. I still have trouble with it.

I watch Note pull something out of his pocket. It looks like a journal. He rapidly scribbles away and nods as he listens to me.

[Ryder] Are you... are you writing that down?

He freezes like a deer caught in headlights, or a kid caught with their hand in the cookie jar.

His cheeks turn red.

That’s the most emotion I’ve seen out of him since the first time I saw him.

Holy shit, my heart.

...

He nods meekly.

[Note] I... forget things like this a lot. And I can’t easily tell when people are uncomfortable. So I like to write people manuals.

"People manuals?" What the fuck? I’ve never heard a more adorable phrase in my life.

I have to keep myself from grinning like an absolute fucking moron.

[Ryder] I get it. It’s kind of the opposite for me, actually. I can usually gauge how people are feeling. I just don’t know how to deal with it, heh.

I might not be smirking like a dork with a crush, but a warm, friendly smile still manages to grace my lips.

[Ryder] I don’t think a ‘people manual’ would help in my case. Even if I knew how to deal with people, it’s the _dealing with_ part that’s hard. I just can’t step outside my comfort zone. It’s like there’s a big brick wall that just keeps me from... doing things, generally.

Now I’m just rambling. He probably doesn’t even care, just giving me that same blank look as when I first saw him.

[Ryder] I can’t read you at all, though. I kinda thought you were a bit robotic when I first met you. Could never tell what you’re thinking or feeling.

He blinks a few times. Silence. Then I start getting flustered and worried again.

[Ryder] I-I didn’t mean that as an insult. It just-

[Note] I get that a lot.

He interrupts me. Despite what I said, even though his tone of voice didn’t change from normal, I could tell it hurt a little to say that. I spotted him clutching the notebook a bit tighter too.

[Ryder] Hey, being different is fine. It’s great, really. It just makes you interesting. People who pick on you and don’t give you the light of day, they don’t deserve you. It looks like you’ve got a really good crew here, though. People who just treat you like... a person, without constantly poking at the un-normal ways that you act.

It hurt for me to say that, too. Somehow, I found something in common between us.

Of course it had to be something pitiful and depressing.

[Note] Un-normal isn’t a word...

Wh-huh? That wasn’t the poin-

Oh wait, he’s doing the thing.

Oh.

Heh.

Heheh.

[Note] ...Um... why are you laughing?

Oh my god. Oh my fucking god, he’s so cute. What the hell is wrong with me?

He still gives me that confused look as my dorkish chuckling dies down. I just... end up quietly staring at him.

I want to hug him.

[Reina] _Oh Ryyyderrr~_

Are you fucking kidding me.

[Reina] C’moooon, I’m hungry! I wanna go to that one bakery down the street.

Get your own goddamn cookies for fuck’s sake.

_God._

...

I sigh. I hate that I can’t keep myself from smiling around her. Especially with how she’s hanging her arms over my shoulders like this. She reels back after I stand up.

[Ryder] There’s a polite way to ask for things, y’know.

[Reina] But you’d be weirded out by that, wouldn’t you?

...Probably. I don’t even need to answer. We both know.

I sigh.

I look back to my former stoic and deathly adorable conversational partner.

[Ryder] Uh... yeah. I guess I’ll be heading out. See you tomorrow?

Note quietly nods. He turns back to pack his stuff as well. But I caught a glimpse of something right before he faced away.

Was that... was that a smile?

A tiny little smirk?

Oh my god. _Fuck me._

I would spend a thousand years in purgatory to see that smile again.

And, of course, as if reading my mind, Reina grins at me.

[Reina] So, are you two done flirting?

I swear I can see the devil horns poking out past her hair.

Note quickly turned his head to us, mouth slightly agape, as if trying to force out an excuse, or clear up a misunderstanding.

Yeah, I’m going to kill her one of these days.

I just take her hand and hurry out of there before Note can see me steaming from the ears.

...Hm. He likes sweets. Maybe I’ll give him something from the bakery tomorrow.

Is bribery a crime if I’m doing it for a hug?

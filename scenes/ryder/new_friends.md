Thankfully, I'm not so much of an idiot that I forget where I'm supposed to go.

It wouldn't matter, though. There are colorful signs plastered on the walls pointing all the new hires in the right direction.

Signs crudely drawn with markers, big bubble letters, with stars and fancy decorations.

And you can't miss the little chibi anime characters saying "Welcome!", "You can do it!", and "Hope you like it at Hilight!"

Heh. I’m lucky no one’s watching me smile like a moron.

Programming, soundtracks, modeling, animation... UI. That's me.

I carefully venture through the room, past all the desks arranged in quad spaces.

The um... _personality_ is overwhelming.

One desk is practically buried in anime figurines, posters, and random props, like toy sabers and Nerf guns.

Another has so many plushies stacked on it, I wonder how they haven't fallen over.

The third has its walls covered in... math equations? And other mugs and posters with references from games that are too obscure for me to remember, but not enough that I still recognize them as references.

It's almost like people are waging a "Most Aggressively Decorated Desk" war out here.

Although, I respect it. Like my sister, I respect anyone who can express themselves so freely like this.

Well, more like envy, but in some way... same thing?

Either way, I reach my desk. It's got my name on it.

Thank God, otherwise I'd have agonized over whether it was actually mine and just awkwardly walked around until I was sure.

A tiger plush sits on my desk, holding a card that reads "Welcome to Team Tiger!"

So the plush person ran out of room. Got it.

Team Tiger, huh? I guess that explains the pictures of animals I saw. A leopard, a lion, a cheetah, a... jaguar, I think? All are big cats.

That's kinda cute.

So it seems like I'll just be sitting and waiting a bit. I must be early.

I look at a clock on the far wall. It's already five past. Maybe-

[???] _GAAAAAASSP!_

Whatever line of thought I was _going to_ have crashed and burned as an extremely exaggerated gasp scares the absolute shitters out of me.

[???] New meat! New meat! New meat!

I can only assume this obtusely hyperactive girl is referring to me.

That inspires confidence.

[Tabby] You must be Ryder! It's great t’meetcha! I'm Tabby!

Her handshake throws me so hard for a loop that I can barely take in her features.

Navy blue shoulder straps showing through the collar of a loose over-the-shoulders cropped orange t-shirt, a pair of jean shorts, white socks, and sneakers to complete.

The worry that I was too casually dressed immediately faded away.

More accurately, Tabby shook it out of me.

Past Tabby, I see another presumed Team Tiger member letting out a big yawn as she approaches, arms stretched high.

She’s wearing a white shirt with shoulder frills, a black skirt with white stockings under, and a black choker.

Elegant. Mysterious. Mature.

That _would've_ been my first impression, but the girl immediately slumps into her desk, grabbing one of the many plushies from the plush mountain next to her.

The mountain is still standing...

[Tabby] Awwh, Runa! Y’can’t just go and take a nap right in front of the newbie, it'll make us look bad!

[Runa] Mmnh. Just a few more minutes...

And she was out, no matter how much Tabby shook her.

I _wish_ I could fall asleep that fast. Damn.

[Tabby] Weeelllll that's _prooobably_ not the best first impression, but trust me when I say that Runa’s the real veteran here! Whatever obscure questions y’might have, high chance she's got an answer!

[Ryder] Uh... r-right. I-

[Tabby] Oh, looks like Note’s just got here too!

Huh? A note got here?

I turned my head to look where Tabby’s looking.

[Ryder] HUAH?!

A person.

There's a person just... there.

They weren't there when I came in.

There's no way I couldn't have seen them.

What the fuck.

[Tabby] C’mon Notey-Note, put down yer work for two seconds to greet our new family member, why dontcha?

Oh, wait... ‘Note’ is his name?

Wait, family member?

[Note] Hello.

Note turned a bit in his swivel chair to me, with a blank, expressionless look, and an equally benign wave.

He looks about my age and height with white hair, fluffy like snow, with deep scarlet-colored irises.

He wore a long red open-shoulder sweater that went past whatever shorts or spats he wore under.

Assuming he wore them.

Worn with a pair of comfy-looking white thigh-high socks, with a visible inch of the two garter straps hooked to them.

He simply sat still in his chair, hands clad in black fingerless gloves planted in his lap.

A small silver heart hung from his necklace. It sparkles in the light of the room.

The band of his necklace rested against a subdued collarbone, only further extenuating his androgynous figure, from his rounded-off shoulders to his hips.

[Tabby] Heya uh... You good there, Ryder?

I flutter my eyelids, looking back and forth between Tabby and Note.

[Ryder] Oh, uh- ...y-yeah. Sorry, just lost in thought for a bit.

I'm such an awful liar. Thankfully, one person is oblivious, another is sleeping, and the third doesn't seem to show any emotion.

Tabby's worried look immediately disappears in place of that bright grin, and she aggressively smacks me on the back.

[Tabby] Well don't space out too much now, y’hear? We've got a meetin’ coming up here soon!

I glance out towards the open halls past our desks, to where people are starting to gather into a larger meeting room.

[Tabby] You can grab a snack or somethin’ if ya want. Meetings suck on an empty stomach, heh.

As if on cue, my stomach unceremoniously growls. I couldn't hide the heat on my cheeks if I tried.

Tabby manages a smirk that somehow rivals my sister's. I'd be impressed if I weren't dematerializing from embarrassment.

I feel a feather-light tap on my shoulder.

[Note] Here... If you like sweets.

Note holds out a cinnamon bun wrapped in plastic. He has a few others stashed on his desk.

Damn, someone came prepared.

[Ryder] Oh, uh... thanks.

I feel a little bad, but I don't really know how to say "no" anyways.

Note quietly nods. He takes one for himself, unwrapping and taking a bite on the way to the meeting room.

I watch him.

...

I feel a gentle elbow at my side. Not enough to hurt, but more than enough to make me squeal like the fairy boy I am.

Not too loudly. Otherwise I might've _actually_ fucking died.

[Tabby] Looks like you've already made a friend! Lil’ ol’ Notey don't share his snacks with just anyone. Took a month for me to get one, can ya believe it?

She laughs as if it's some grand phenomenon, but I bet she just begged him and he eventually caved.

[Runa] He just caved after you pestered him enough.

Knew it.

Looks like sleeping beauty came back to the land of the living, though.

She does another yawn and stretch before returning her plush to its rightful place in the tower.

The tower that...

No, fuck you. I don't fucking care. That pile of plush should be _toppling_. **Crumbling**. I \*absolutely fucking **refuse\*** to believe any human on this _damned_ gay Earth has the necessary finesse to-

[Tabby] Well, that's what we call haggling back where I'm from! I gave ‘im something back the next day, ‘member?

[Runa] A head ruffle isn't equivalent exchange for food.

[Tabby] Well it darn sure looked like he appreciated it!

...

The two continued like this as they followed Note to the meeting room.

Runa doesn't seem to know the true value of a head ruffle. I wonder what dystopian world she came from.

[Runa] Ryder, are you coming?

[Ryder] Oh, yeah. Sorry.

I hurry up a bit to catch up before matching their pace. I unwrap my bun for a bite while I'm at it.

...

This is the same bun that tempts me whenever I'm checking out at CVS.

But it tastes a lot... sweeter.

And softer.

...

I take another bite.
